# plivo-conference
A code challenge I completed. This app takes 2 phone numbers as inputs, and calls both of those numbers via Plivo's REST api. When both parties answer, the two numbers are bridged together via a conference line.

To improve user experience I added a dynamic phone number form to ensure proper input of phone numbers.

Technologies:

- Node.js
- Plivo Voice API
- Foundation framework
- HTML/CSS
